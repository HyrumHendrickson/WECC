I included 3 different methods to load the data

.qmd (markdown file for r) 
.py (basic python file) 
.ipynb (jupyter notebook file) 

clone this repository to experiment with the data on your own

in the scraper folder I have a program that can collect data for whichever dates or times you need,
but the program will need api keys, both of which you should be able to get for free

the scraper also contain some files with sample data
